# Spanscriptomics: Single cell analysis using Galaxy

![Course logo](logo.png){: style="float: right" width="300px"}

[En Español]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link events/spanscriptomics/index.md %})

On November 29th & 30th, 2021, we will organize a global 2-day Galaxy Training event on single cell analysis using GTN (Galaxy Training Network) tutorials. This will be an **online event**, spanning **all time zones.** All training sessions are pre-recorded, so you can work through them **at your own pace** and manage your own time.


**What is single cell analysis?** Specifically, here we specifically focus on single cell RNA-seq, where all (or a subset!) of the transcripts of a cell are identified. While computationally tricky, this powerful technique is being used by biologists [around the world!](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.710971/full#h1) to identify all the cell types within organisms, across disease, age, and more.

There will be a trained, expert team during the course dedicated to guiding you, answering your questions and making sure you learn not only at your own pace but that you leave with the skills you have signed up to learn. Reach out! Whether you are stuck, confused or need clarification. We look forward to hearing from you during the course!

## Spanscriptomics: "Why?"

This workshop is **aimed at native Spanish** speakers around the world. The Galaxy Training Ñetwork of native Spanish speaking bioinformaticians has developed Spanish translated materials. This workshop forms part of a wider study on the [impact of translating materials!](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02218-x?utm_source=twt_nat&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=nature) from English into Spanish. While you will be given the option of whether to use English, auto-translated Spanish, or human-translated Spanish resources throughout the workshop, we will randomly assign you to a language-stream to start you off. To be clear, you can change at any time!
The language survey within this workshop forms part of a larger project on decolonisation of science education, which may lead to large-scale translation of learning materials both from and into English. We appreciate your participation in this study!

As part of the research study, we will send out a survey that will take five to ten minutes at the end of the workshop, which will include a question on whether you swapped language-streams or not.
